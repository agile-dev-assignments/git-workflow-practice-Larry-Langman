## My Comment
I found this article interesting because it discusses Amazon's cloud computing and the work of consultants in critiquing the service. It is easy to forget just how massive cloud computing is becoming. For most, Amazon is known for its retail side; however, its cloud computing component is very large and growing quickly. The article discusses subjects such as product naming and the relationship between large companies such as Amazon and Google, and their critics. These "critics" are consultants who are paid by the companies to write honest opinions on their products. This in turn allows the large firms to find flaws they may otherwise miss and generates positive publicity for firm successes. Since the article was written from the perspective of one of the consultants, it adds a different analysis of the field which in turn allows one to better understand Amazon and the relationship between its software, its cloud infrastructure, and its consultants.

Thought this was a super interesting read, Larry! Cloud computing has made some serious headway over the last few years. Not to mention, AWS is now Amazonâ€™s primary revenue driver.
